I've landed in Goa, famous for its beaches and festive atmosphere. Knowing it's the low season, I don't expect to party but more to chill and relax...


<b> Goa </b>

My trip will start at Panjim and Old Goa, both famous for their architecture inherited during Portuguese colony in the 15th century. The remains of the city are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.




I continue my way up north to Vagator, well known for its nightlife. Unfortunately, the high season only starts from November. But on the other hand, it was perfect to chill (under the rain) and meet awesome locals and indian tourists sharing our life philosophy.

The best way to travel in Goa is by renting a bike (understand a motorbike) which I won't since it looks too dangerous with all this rain.
Moreover, it makes such a mess to see all those scooties and bikes all over the place, driving crazy in the hill of Vagator, and disturbing the tranquility of the place.





After 3 days of rain I decide to go on and travel more inland towards Karnataka state
