Waking up at 5.30am, I’ve already arranged my bag storage with the hotel I’m staying in (this time I’ll hike with the small one), a last goodbye to Andy my fellow traveler and I’m already in a Jeep for Maney Bhanjyang, point of entry to any hike in the area. The “Highlander Guide Welfare Association” found me a guide within 10min and I’m passing my first police checkpoint for Nepal\u0026hellip;The hike I’m planning to do is on the ridge between Nepal and India and they warned me to bring my passport as I’ll be crossing the borders between both countries multiple times. It’s the best opportunity to see Everest (8840m) and Kanchenjunga (8586m), respectively n1 and n3 of highest peaks in the world, K2 (8611m), in Pakistan, being N2.\nThe Summary   The Circuit Singalila National Park is situated on the north western part of Darjeeling district. The ridge trek is one of the oldest in India, and definitely one of the easiest wrt scenery provided!\nThe complete trek route is available on the following map and GPX route can be downloaded below :\n Day 1 - Maney Bhanjyang - Jaubari Day 2 - Jaubari - Sandakphu Day 3 - Sandakphu - Phalut Day 4 - Phalut - Raman Day 5 - Raman - Rimbik   Day 1 : Maney Bhanjyang - Jaubari After a quick momo breakfast, I’m greeting my new guide « Buddha » (no it’s not a joke) who will join me on this 5 days trip. He’s wearing his sneakers, a jogging (could have been my pyjama) and a small backpack like mine.\nThe way is easy to follow, and we gradually climb through beautiful forests (rhododendrons, magnolias, primulas, bamboos and pines) surrounded by a deep (even sometimes cold) mist.\n    Our first break will be the small village of Chitrey and its important monastery.\n       Then we came across Lamadhura and Meghma, where we took a tea break in front of its monastery.\n       We finally ascent the last 2km to Tumling for a delicious and grateful dal bhat. Our final stop for the day will be Jaubari, another small village up in the valley at almost 3000m\n        We’ll spend the rest of the afternoon and evening in the kitchen, close to the open fire where the hosts are chopping the organic veggies (I’ll learn that the spinach easily grow in cow poo) and cooking, trying to warm us up. Really nice and interesting way of spending time that I didn’t experience on Annapurna side. The owner son speaks really well English so we’ll discuss about society and lifestyle.\nThe night being cloudy, I won’t even try to catch the sunset.\nDistance : 15.8 km Duration : 4h30 Elevation gain : 1250m\nDay 2 : Jaubari - Sandakphu We woke up at 5.30am to witness an amazing sunrise and my first sight of Everest, while Kanchenjunga was still under the morning clouds.\n          Slightly climbing uphill to Gairibas, surrounded by dense forests, we will stop in Kalapokhari for lunch.\nBuddha doesn’t talk that much, he is sometimes ahead, sometimes behind, so there won’t be a lot of talking nor learning during the whole hike, but still he\u0026rsquo;s nice.\nI’ll leave him behind and reach Sandakphu on a though ascent. The panoramic view of mountains from Nepal to India up to Bhutan is astonishing : Everest, Kanchenjunga, Makalu, Lhotse, Kumbakarna, Chomolari, Three Sisters \u0026hellip; peaks are viewed in a single stretch. The view of Kumbakarna to Pandim peaks is referred as “Sleeping Buddha” (you might notice it as well on the picture).\nWith another tourist I’ve met on the way we will walk another kilometer or so to reach a scenic sunset viewpoint. Being above the clouds gives that impression of floating on them while the mountains remind me of islands in this whole surrealist scenery! I’ve probably never took that many pics before.\nA group of Indians will party with some local music and “rocksy” (local beverage), it was funny until they came back to the dormitory snoring :) the night will be short.\nDistance : 16.5 km Duration : 4h30 Elevation gain : 1200m\nDay 3 : Sandakphu - Phalut After another stunning sunrise, we took the trek going up and down towards Phalut. It will mainly follow the old scenic road, not too busy with tourists jeeps. The scenery is amazing, still walking on the ridge with Nepal on our left including Everest, Makalu and Lhotse peaks, and India on our right displaying Kumbakarna, Pandim and Kanchenjunga peaks!\nFrom Phalut, Kanchenjunga is only 11km flying distance. We won’t be any closer.\nI’ll climb Phalut peak before 5pm to enjoy an interesting sunset in the clouds and have a last glimpse of Everest before dark.\nThe guesthouse don’t have any water (cold or hot) so it’s another night without shower and sleeping with all my clothes on to fight the coldness of the night. We’ll share 2 beds with 3 persons, no choice as they’re running out of accommodation.\nDistance : 18 km Duration : 5h00 Elevation gain : 840m\nDay 4 : Phalut - Raman This morning, around 5am, after a good rest, we climbed again the Phalut hill to enjoy another amazing sunrise over Indian mountains, while the light started to hit Everest and Kanchenjunga. Another cold but rewarding morning ! It’s impressive and different from what we’ve seen from Sandakphu.\nThe way down to Ghorkey passes through bamboo forest, going from 3600m to 2300m. It’s pretty easy and areally nice hike in the shade. We’ll then cross Samanden, a tiny beautiful village before ascending up to our final destination: Raman.\nThe guesthouse we’re staying in is very clean compared to what we’ve experienced before and the hosts really lovely. It’s the first time they’ll invite me to the “kitchen” (being their living room as all other places in Nepal, the open fire being the center of all attention) where I’ll catch some Nepalese discussion and mostly watch them cooking in silence. I’ll eat my best dal bhat of this trek, accompanied by some local chips and Xxx pakhora? The curry is interesting and yummy as they’ve added some kind of cucumber/pickle to it. The hosts will smile at me and they’ll definitely make this local and authentic evening my best Nepalese experience so far.\nDistance : 17 km Duration : 4h30 Elevation gain : 450m\nDay 5 : Raman - Rimbik Basically just going down on the road to reach Rimbik, before getting a Jeep back to Darjeeling.\nDistance : 11.8 km Duration : 2h30\nElevation gain : 290m\n","permalink":"https://benontrack.netlify.app/blog/2019-11-15-singalila-ridge-trek/","tags":["Hiking","India","Video"],"title":"Singalila Ridge Trek"},{"categories":["Asia"],"contents":"The Circuit After a few more days spent in Varanasi, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to reach Nepal to start my hiking journey since the high season is already on. I\u0026rsquo;ve met Andy, my Uruguayan friend who will join me on this adventure. We\u0026rsquo;ve spent a good 17h on the bus (insane trafic jam on the mountain), crossed the border at around 6am and just arrived in Kathmandu where we\u0026rsquo;ll spend a day to accommodate ourself, grab our hiking permits and buy some \u0026ldquo;North Fake\u0026rdquo; hiking gears!\nOur 15 days circuit started at Besisahar and ended at Ghandruk, in the Himalaya.\n The Summary   Day 1 : Besisahar - Bhulbhule We left Kathmandu with the 7am bus to Besisahar. The bus was supposed to take 7h to travel the 175km route but with the traffic jam in the valley we only arrived by 4pm. We decided to walk straight (instead of taking the bus) to reach Bhulbhule before night.\nWe stayed in Manang Hotel (it’s a teahouse) : the place is very typical, with small wooden room and outdoor shared bathroom. The host was nice and helpful and we helped him to add his teahouse on OpenStreetMap.\n             document.getElementById('gallery1_links').onclick = function (event) { event = event || window.event var target = event.target || event.srcElement var link = target.src ? target.parentNode : target var options = { index: link, event: event } var links = this.getElementsByTagName('a') blueimp.Gallery(links, options) }   blueimp.Gallery(document.getElementById('gallery1_links').getElementsByTagName('a'), { container: '#gallery1', carousel: true })   Distance : 9 km Elevation : 365m+ Time : 2h30\nDay 2 : Bhulbhule - Jagat For our first full hiking day, our goal was to reach Ghermu. The landscape was a beautiful mix of rice fields and waterfalls ! That gave us enough energy to continue a little bit further and we finally decided to settle in Jagat. As soon as we arrived we had been approached by a lot of hosts asking us to stay in their property, so we just started to prepare a list of “requirements” for our next tea house : free room if we eat dinner and breakfast Sitting toilet Hot shower what we found at «Mont Blanc» hotel. The view was nice and we met some nice people but still most of the tea houses were pretty empty for this high season.\n                                       document.getElementById('gallery2_links').onclick = function (event) { event = event || window.event var target = event.target || event.srcElement var link = target.src ? target.parentNode : target var options = { index: link, event: event } var links = this.getElementsByTagName('a') blueimp.Gallery(links, options) }   blueimp.Gallery(document.getElementById('gallery2_links').getElementsByTagName('a'), { container: '#gallery2', carousel: true })   Distance : 21 km Elevation : 1150m+ Time : 8h30\nDay 3 : Jagat - Danagyu Another quiet day enjoying the landscape, more waterfalls and more bridges above the river.\nWe have crossed a lot of tiny typical villages, up in the mountains, experiencing our first Nepalese stairs.\nOn the way to Danagyu a Nepalese woman told us to stay at Annapurna hotel, what we will do.\nThe place was really nice and we met a couple of Chilean travelling with an Argentinian guy that they met on their way.\n                            document.getElementById('gallery3_links').onclick = function (event) { event = event || window.event var target = event.target || event.srcElement var link = target.src ? target.parentNode : target var options = { index: link, event: event } var links = this.getElementsByTagName('a') blueimp.Gallery(links, options) }   blueimp.Gallery(document.getElementById('gallery3_links').getElementsByTagName('a'), { container: '#gallery3', carousel: true })   Distance : 25 km Elevation : 1000m+ Time : 9h\nDay 4 : Danagyu - Upper Pisang Probably the best day hike for the scenery! We met a lot of trekkers walking on the main road while we walked, alone, on amazing remote trails on the other side of the river. It was one of our longest and most wonderful day!\n                            document.getElementById('gallery4_links').onclick = function (event) { event = event || window.event var target = event.target || event.srcElement var link = target.src ? target.parentNode : target var options = { index: link, event: event } var links = this.getElementsByTagName('a') blueimp.Gallery(links, options) }   blueimp.Gallery(document.getElementById('gallery4_links').getElementsByTagName('a'), { container: '#gallery4', carousel: true })   Distance : 29 km Elevation : 800m+ Time : 10h\nDay 5 : Upper Pisang - Manang After a good night rest, our target was Manang and its high altitude (3700m) before experiencing hiking above 4000m.\nThe hike was just lovely and to my opinion the best on this part of the Annapurna circuit, as it mostly went far away from the road to more remote villages.\nAfter Ghyaru and its crazy slided turns going up and Ngawal standing up on the hill, we decided to avoid the nominal circuit and keep going up to Chulu for lunch. The problem is that the only restaurant was closed, but after a few “Namaste” yelled in the air, a woman answered and proposed us to have lunch at her place : that moment will be the most authentic lunch we had experienced in the whole circuit. The house was tiny, with the cow cottage on the floor level, that we had to climb through a small ladder to reach the open air terrace. We waited around 1h for our lunch but I definitely had the best Dal Bhat of my life for a few roupies!\nThe way down was lovely too in the dusty forest, surrounded by yaks and cows. We then got lost in a monastery, decided to climb up the wall to get out of it, got back on our feet, opened a door and realized we just got back to the monastery again (so funny!) the way was full of hitchy trees and we finally found a way to “escape” without being noticed. The rest of the hike down to Braka was easy and beautiful and we decided to stay overnight in Manang.\nWe tried our “requirement” list again and found a dodgy hotel that offered us the room for free but they didn’t have plugs nor hot shower so we didn’t stay there the second night.\n                          document.getElementById('gallery5_links').onclick = function (event) { event = event || window.event var target = event.target || event.srcElement var link = target.src ? target.parentNode : target var options = { index: link, event: event } var links = this.getElementsByTagName('a') blueimp.Gallery(links, options) }   blueimp.Gallery(document.getElementById('gallery5_links').getElementsByTagName('a'), { container: '#gallery5', carousel: true })   Distance : 23 km Elevation : 1000m+ Time : 09h00\nDay 6 : Acclimatization in Manang After checking a few places we ended up in Moonlight Hotel and absolutely did \u0026hellip; nothing but resting all day.\nI was still looking for a sleeping bag but finally decided I could make the trip without as you can get extra blanket for a few fee, but the nights being colder and colder I decided to invest in a Nepalese gloves made of yak wool and a neck scarf (those would save my life a few days later)\nOtherwise we spent the day in our little balcony of Moonlight Hotel enjoying the sun and the lively town of Manang.\nDay 7 : Manang - Tilicho Base Camp We woke up a bit before 6am but our breakfast wasn’t ready so we left Manang by 6.45am.\nWe really appreciated the hike through Lower-Mid-Upper Khangsar as we didn’t meet anyone on our way but after was not really the same as the hike was mostly on the landslide.\nArrived in Tilicho Base Camp by noon, the place was horrible, full of people and no more room available. We managed to find a room (expensive) and really rustic and cold but still better than nothing.\n                 document.getElementById('gallery7_links').onclick = function (event) { event = event || window.event var target = event.target || event.srcElement var link = target.src ? target.parentNode : target var options = { index: link, event: event } var links = this.getElementsByTagName('a') blueimp.Gallery(links, options) }   blueimp.Gallery(document.getElementById('gallery7_links').getElementsByTagName('a'), { container: '#gallery7', carousel: true })   Distance : 17 km Elevation : 1000m+ Time : 06h00\nDay 8 : Tilicho Base Camp - Yak Kharka The alarm rang at 4am as expected. We hardly slept again due to low temperature. We tried to fill our water bottle but all tap were frozen! So we did refill on the way through the river (worthless since our Lifestraw did froze too !). The hike was terrible due to dangerous landslide but the experience under the stars and before the sunrise was just amazing. When we reached the lake our hands were frozen but again the view was worth it!\nWe ran on our way back, arrived at the hostel by 9am and took a quick nap before leaving to Yak Kharka. All the way up to Upper Khangsar was exactly the same as the day before, so we didn’t really appreciated but the end of the hike through the forest was really fun.\nThat day was so hard but we made it! So proud of ourselves. The best thing is Yak Kharka was definitely the hot shower!\n                       document.getElementById('gallery8_links').onclick = function (event) { event = event || window.event var target = event.target || event.srcElement var link = target.src ? target.parentNode : target var options = { index: link, event: event } var links = this.getElementsByTagName('a') blueimp.Gallery(links, options) }   blueimp.Gallery(document.getElementById('gallery8_links').getElementsByTagName('a'), { container: '#gallery8', carousel: true })   Distance : 29 km Elevation : 1800m+ Time : 12h30\nDay 9 : Yak Kharka - Thorong La High Camp We woke up early again as our goal was to reach High Camp and got a room. The hike was mostly going up, in the rocky mountain up to Thorong Phedi where we took a quick break and finally started our hike up to High Camp : that was hard but the view was rewarding! The Camp was far better than Tilicho Base Camp, our room even had light!\nAs we arrived early we decided to climb to the upper view point to appreciate the view.\nWe spent the rest of the day chilling and talking with people we met earlier on the trek.\n                    document.getElementById('gallery9_links').onclick = function (event) { event = event || window.event var target = event.target || event.srcElement var link = target.src ? target.parentNode : target var options = { index: link, event: event } var links = this.getElementsByTagName('a') blueimp.Gallery(links, options) }   blueimp.Gallery(document.getElementById('gallery9_links').getElementsByTagName('a'), { container: '#gallery9', carousel: true })   Distance : 9 km Elevation : 900m+ Time : 04h00\nDay 10 : Thorong La High Camp - Jharkot I couldn’t breathe\u0026hellip;just walking up the few hundred meters from our room to the dining hall for our early 4.30am breakfast I realized I walked too fast and ended up breathing in and out in front of the door below zero degree Celsius. We started around 5am and again I felt really cold with my few gears! We hardly saw the sunrise (which was in our back) and my hands were deeply frozen to take any pictures\u0026hellip; Some people were crying on the way due to the hard feeling of inability to breathe, while we had some issues too but always stopped on time to rest a bit before going on.\nWe reached La pass around 6.30am, so proud of ourselves and enjoyed a hot boiling tea in a tiny wooden tea house at 5416m!\nWe thought we did the hardest part but on my side i felt the descent even harder as it was steep and sometimes slippery while my knees were keeping me up.\nWe finally reached Muktinath around 10.30am and decided to visit the monastery while we were there. After a good lunch under the sun, we kept walking a bit further up to Jharkot to avoid other tourists and it was probably our best choice of the day!\n                        document.getElementById('gallery10_links').onclick = function (event) { event = event || window.event var target = event.target || event.srcElement var link = target.src ? target.parentNode : target var options = { index: link, event: event } var links = this.getElementsByTagName('a') blueimp.Gallery(links, options) }   blueimp.Gallery(document.getElementById('gallery10_links').getElementsByTagName('a'), { container: '#gallery10', carousel: true })   Distance : 18 km Elevation : 570m+ Time : 06h00\nDay 11 : Jharkot - Marpha Horrible\u0026hellip;that was probably the summary of today! We started the hike after a good night and an excellent breakfast, but after nothing really worked for us.\nFirst, we didn’t plan to go up, but the first hour was just a nightmare : Andy lost his smartphone on the way and hopefully we found it back. We arrived in Lupra and took a quick rest while my feet started to hurt already (so many blisters coming up). Then we just followed the Annapurna Circuit to Jomsom on a dangerous landslide trail and arrived on a dead-end! We were so pissed off as no sign warned us of this blocked trail and thanks to Andy we managed to climb down the last 10m using his rope to pass our bags from the top : scary adventure - we have informed the check post but they seem not really interested to know that issue. Then under a strong wind in this dusty environment, we follow the river bed up to Jomsom (horrible trail walking on rock and sand, definitely not helping my blisters).\nJomsom had nothing to offer so we followed the path (on a dusty road) up to Marpha where we found our happiness for the rest of the afternoon!\nIt looked that this side of the mountain was less interesting so far.\n                        document.getElementById('gallery11_links').onclick = function (event) { event = event || window.event var target = event.target || event.srcElement var link = target.src ? target.parentNode : target var options = { index: link, event: event } var links = this.getElementsByTagName('a') blueimp.Gallery(links, options) }   blueimp.Gallery(document.getElementById('gallery11_links').getElementsByTagName('a'), { container: '#gallery11', carousel: true })   Distance : 24 km Elevation : 800m+ Time : 07h00\nDay 12 : Marpha - Ghansa Probably the most painful day hike on my side due to my blisters. The hike mostly going down it didn’t help my feet.\nMost of the trail was destroyed so we had to walk on the dusty road, avoiding the Jeep, bus and other bikes.\nArrived in Ghansa, we will stop in a guesthouse and find out that all the remaining trekkers finishing the Annapurna circuit stopped in the same guesthouse making our dinner funny and interesting!\n                   document.getElementById('gallery12_links').onclick = function (event) { event = event || window.event var target = event.target || event.srcElement var link = target.src ? target.parentNode : target var options = { index: link, event: event } var links = this.getElementsByTagName('a') blueimp.Gallery(links, options) }   blueimp.Gallery(document.getElementById('gallery12_links').getElementsByTagName('a'), { container: '#gallery12', carousel: true })   Distance : 30 km Elevation : 1000m+\nTime : 10h00\nDay 13 : Ghansa - Tatopani Another non really interesting day hike that we had finish pretty early in order to rest our feet.\n               document.getElementById('gallery13_links').onclick = function (event) { event = event || window.event var target = event.target || event.srcElement var link = target.src ? target.parentNode : target var options = { index: link, event: event } var links = this.getElementsByTagName('a') blueimp.Gallery(links, options) }   blueimp.Gallery(document.getElementById('gallery13_links').getElementsByTagName('a'), { container: '#gallery13', carousel: true })   Distance : 16 km Elevation : 600m+\nTime : 05h30\nDay 14 : Tatopani - Ghorepani We just thought that after Thorang La pass we would only go down but that didn’t happen. The way to Ghorepani was a deep ascent on the rocky mountain, passing a lot of villages and forgetting our feet issues! We really loved it and arrived before lunch at Ghorepani making it our first full stop (lunch, dinner, breakfast).\n                 document.getElementById('gallery14_links').onclick = function (event) { event = event || window.event var target = event.target || event.srcElement var link = target.src ? target.parentNode : target var options = { index: link, event: event } var links = this.getElementsByTagName('a') blueimp.Gallery(links, options) }   blueimp.Gallery(document.getElementById('gallery14_links').getElementsByTagName('a'), { container: '#gallery14', carousel: true })   Distance : 16 km Elevation : 1700m+\nTime : 07h00\nDay 15 : Ghorepani - Poon Hill - Ghandruk We’ve reached day #15, the final descent to Ghandruk before getting a bus to Pokhara.\nBut before any descend, we started our day by a little ascent to Poon Hill to enjoy our first real sunrise! It was beautiful even if really crowded.\nThe descent will be easier than expected running on the steep stairs through the dense forest to alleviate our knees.\n                        document.getElementById('gallery15_links').onclick = function (event) { event = event || window.event var target = event.target || event.srcElement var link = target.src ? target.parentNode : target var options = { index: link, event: event } var links = this.getElementsByTagName('a') blueimp.Gallery(links, options) }   blueimp.Gallery(document.getElementById('gallery15_links').getElementsByTagName('a'), { container: '#gallery15', carousel: true })   Distance : 19 km Elevation : 1100m+\nTime : 05h30\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been an amazing circuit that we will remember for a long time!\n","permalink":"https://benontrack.netlify.app/blog/2019-11-08-nepal-the-annapurna-circuit/","tags":["Sport","Hiking","Nepal"],"title":"Nepal - The Annapurna circuit"},{"categories":["Recipe"],"contents":"I have attended a cooking class in Udaipur, Rajasthan, that I am willing to share with you !

This World Heritage Site contains a rich collection of archaeological spots of which several remain in use as holy places and temples : the most famous being Ruwanwelisaya (white stupa) as it contains relics of Buddha. Most of them have been restored.\nWe have rented a bike to explore them in a cheap and eco way !\n                        From there, we\u0026rsquo;ll head south to our second stop in the Cultural triangle : Dambulla. This is the largest and best preserved cave temple complex of Sri Lanka, with wonderful paintings and statues !\n                                  We won\u0026rsquo;t stay overnight in Dambulla but instead we will push forward up to Sigiriya and make it home for the next 2 days.\nFirst we\u0026rsquo;ll visit Poḷonnaruwa : the second most ancient of Sri Lanka\u0026rsquo;s kingdoms. As for Anurâdhapura, we decide to rent a bike to enjoy the beauty of this huge archeological site (my favorite so far). It\u0026rsquo;s also part of UNESCO and it will cost you another 25USD fee to visit, but definitely worth it.\n                                        It\u0026rsquo;s now time to climb the \u0026ldquo;Lion rock\u0026rdquo; of Sigiriya : a huge fortress established on a top of this 200m high rock, introduced with a gateway built in a form of an enormous lion (giving its name to the city - Sigiriya means Lion).\nWe have really appreciated the frescoes : for once it won\u0026rsquo;t be Buddha\u0026rsquo;s but instead gorgeous representation of Sri Lankan ladies (unfortunately no pictures allowed).\n                        Our next stop will be Kandy, apparently base of one of the most scenic train ride in the World ! We won\u0026rsquo;t take the full ride up to Ella (7hours) but we will stop instead in Nuwara Eliya, famous for its country side filled by tea plantation.\nWe have visited Pedro Tea Factory, trying to understand the tea process and fabrication, but the main reason we came in Nuwara Eliya was to hike the Horton Plains National Park and its famous \u0026ldquo;World\u0026rsquo;s End\u0026rdquo; hike (under the mist in this cloud forest)!\n                            We still had a great time and now deserve a good local ayurveda (meaning \u0026ldquo;the science of life\u0026rdquo;) massage:\nAyurveda represents a system of healing that has been perfected over more than five thousand years. It is famed as South Asia\u0026rsquo;s ancient health care system based on herbs and diet. Ayurveda sees health and disease in holistic terms. It takes into account the relationship between energy and matter. This system of healing believes in treatment of not just the part affected by disease but the individual as a whole. It emphasizes on the harmony of mind, body and spirit to cure diseases.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s almost already the end of our experience in Sri Lanka, and we\u0026rsquo;ll forever remember the kindness of those people and the beauty of the country (including amazing roads conditions).\nWe still have a lot to visit, especially the beach side so it\u0026rsquo;s not a goodbye but a see you soon.\n\u0026ldquo;Wisdom can be found traveling\u0026rdquo; - Sri Lankan proverb\n","permalink":"https://benontrack.netlify.app/blog/2019-09-26-sri-lanka-the-hidden-gem/","tags":["Sri Lanka","Video"],"title":"Sri Lanka - The hidden gem"},{"categories":["Asia"],"contents":"Heading south to Kerala and its famous backwaters\nKerala After another terrible night bus trip from Bangalore, and a small ferry trip, I\u0026rsquo;ve reached Kochi, my first city in Kerala on the Malabar coast of India.\nKochi (and its fort) has nothing really interesting to offer apart from its lively fish market and unfamous chinese fishnet.\n                         I\u0026rsquo;ll quickly reach Alleppey, famous for its beach vibes, canals and backwaters.

The remains of the city are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n         I continue my way up north to Vagator, well known for its nightlife. Unfortunately, the high season only starts from November. But on the other hand, it was perfect to chill (under the rain) and meet awesome locals and indian tourists sharing our life philosophy.\nThe best way to travel in Goa is by renting a bike (understand a motorbike) which I won\u0026rsquo;t since it looks too dangerous with all this rain.
