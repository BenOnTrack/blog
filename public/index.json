This World Heritage Site contains a rich collection of archaeological spots of which several remain in use as holy places and temples : the most famous being Ruwanwelisaya (white stupa) as it contains relics of Buddha. Most of them have been restored.\nWe have rented a bike to explore them in a cheap and eco way !\nFrom there, we\u0026rsquo;ll head south to our second stop in the Cultural triangle : Dambulla. This is the largest and best preserved cave temple complex of Sri Lanka, with wonderful paintings and statues !\nWe won\u0026rsquo;t stay overnight in Dambulla but instead we will push forward up to Sigiriya and make it home for the next 2 days.\nFirst we\u0026rsquo;ll visit Poḷonnaruwa : the second most ancient of Sri Lanka\u0026rsquo;s kingdoms. As for Anurâdhapura, we decide to rent a bike to enjoy the beauty of this huge archeological site (my favorite so far). It\u0026rsquo;s also part of UNESCO and it will cost you another 25USD fee to visit, but definitely worth it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s now time to climb the \u0026ldquo;Lion rock\u0026rdquo; of Sigiriya : a huge fortress established on a top of this 200m high rock, introduced with a gateway built in a form of an enormous lion (giving its name to the city - Sigiriya means Lion).\nWe have really appreciated the frescoes : for once it won\u0026rsquo;t be Buddha\u0026rsquo;s but instead gorgeous representation of Sri Lankan ladies (unfortunately no pictures allowed).\nOur next stop will be Kandy, apparently base of one of the most scenic train ride in the World ! We won\u0026rsquo;t take the full ride up to Ella (7hours) but we will stop instead in Nuwara Eliya, famous for its country side filled by tea plantation.\nWe have visited Pedro Tea Factory, trying to understand the tea process and fabrication, but the main reason we came in Nuwara Eliya was to hike the Horton Plains National Park and its famous \u0026ldquo;World\u0026rsquo;s End\u0026rdquo; hike (under the mist in this cloud forest)!\n We still had a great time and now deserve a good local ayurveda (meaning \u0026ldquo;the science of life\u0026rdquo;) massage:\nAyurveda represents a system of healing that has been perfected over more than five thousand years. It is famed as South Asia\u0026rsquo;s ancient health care system based on herbs and diet. Ayurveda sees health and disease in holistic terms. It takes into account the relationship between energy and matter. This system of healing believes in treatment of not just the part affected by disease but the individual as a whole. It emphasizes on the harmony of mind, body and spirit to cure diseases.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s almost already the end of our experience in Sri Lanka, and we\u0026rsquo;ll forever remember the kindness of those people and the beauty of the country (including amazing roads conditions).\nWe still have a lot to visit, especially the beach side so it\u0026rsquo;s not a goodbye but a see you soon.\n\u0026ldquo;Wisdom can be found traveling\u0026rdquo; - Sri Lankan proverb\n","permalink":"https://benontrack.netlify.app/blog/2019-09-26-sri-lanka-the-hidden-gem/","tags":["Sri Lanka"],"title":"Sri Lanka - The hidden gem"},{"categories":["Asia"],"contents":"Heading south to Kerala and its famous backwaters\n Kerala \nAfter another terrible night bus trip from Bangalore, and a small ferry trip, I\u0026rsquo;ve reached Kochi, my first city in Kerala on the Malabar coast of India.\nKochi (and its fort) has nothing really interesting to offer apart from its lively fish market and unfamous chinese fishnet.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll quickly reach Alleppey, famous for its beach vibes, canals and backwaters. We took a tour with Zostel hostel, enjoying this so-called \u0026ldquo;Venice of the East\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s been a really interesting and relaxing experience, especially eating with locals on a flooded house! Most people rent a houseboat and cross the whole canal from Alleppey to Kollam. I\u0026rsquo;ll do the same with the local ferry, heading to Trivandrum to catch my flight to Sri Lanka !\n","permalink":"https://benontrack.netlify.app/blog/2019-09-18-india-kerala/","tags":["India"],"title":"India - Kerala"},{"categories":["Asia"],"contents":"I\u0026rsquo;ve landed in Goa, famous for its beaches and festive atmosphere. Knowing it\u0026rsquo;s the low season, I don\u0026rsquo;t expect to party but more to chill and relax\u0026hellip;\n Goa \nMy trip will start at Panjim and Old Goa, both famous for their architecture inherited during Portuguese colony in the 15th century. The remains of the city are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nI continue my way up north to Vagator, well known for its nightlife. Unfortunately, the high season only starts from November. But on the other hand, it was perfect to chill (under the rain) and meet awesome locals and indian tourists sharing our life philosophy.\nThe best way to travel in Goa is by renting a bike (understand a motorbike) which I won\u0026rsquo;t since it looks too dangerous with all this rain. Moreover, it makes such a mess to see all those scooties and bikes all over the place, driving crazy in the hill of Vagator, and disturbing the tranquility of the place.\nAfter 3 days of rain I decide to go on and travel more inland towards Karnataka state\n","permalink":"https://benontrack.netlify.app/blog/2019-09-17-india-goa/","tags":["India"],"title":"India - Goa"},{"categories":["Asia"],"contents":"I\u0026rsquo;ve landed in Mumbai (also known as Bombay), capital city of Maharashtra. It\u0026rsquo;s funny to know that Mumbai city population exceeds the entire belgian population. Actually it\u0026rsquo;s the most densely populated megacity in the world.\nMaharashtra\nIt\u0026rsquo;s past midnight, the airport is huge, the customs are easier to pass than I thought and a Uber staff helps me getting some Wifi to book my first indian ride (knowing Uber is a good deal not to get screwed by local taxi, especially when you don\u0026rsquo;t have any local currency on arrival).\nI guess I\u0026rsquo;m not used to see that many people at the same place at the same time, especially when it\u0026rsquo;s now 2am and that there is more traffic jam than in the middle of the day, but I still enjoy the special atmosphere and vibes I\u0026rsquo;m getting here.\nMumbai is that kind of busy city I\u0026rsquo;ve never really experienced in the past, but after a few hours wandering in the city you easily make your own way like a local : crossing the boulevard in the middle of the traffic (running for your life as they say), healing a rickshaw (tuk-tuk), hoping on a moving train,\u0026hellip;kind of adventure I was looking for.\nWith all this rain I won\u0026rsquo;t make it to Dharavi slum\nI forgot to mention that Ganesh (widely revered as the remover of obstacles, the patron of arts and sciences and the deva of intellect and wisdom, cf Wikipedia) is running on for 10 days all over the country and especially here in Mumbai ! At the end of the festival, the idols (mostly statue) will be immersed in the most convenient body of water (which will be the ocean for Mumbai).\nUnfortunately it\u0026rsquo;s the monsoon period and it\u0026rsquo;s pouring rain ! I guess it\u0026rsquo;s time to go south.\n","permalink":"https://benontrack.netlify.app/blog/2019-09-17-india-maharashtra/","tags":["India"],"title":"India - Maharashtra"},{"categories":["Tips"],"contents":"Discover the must-have apps any traveler should have on his/her smartphone\u0026hellip;\nMaps.me - Find your way!\nWhen it comes to travel abroad, there will always be a time when you\u0026rsquo;ll need to find your location.
