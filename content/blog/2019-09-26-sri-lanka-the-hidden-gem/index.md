Starting from Colombo city, we decide to travel around the Cultural triangle of Sri Lanka...

After a quick discussion with Benoît who's joining me on this trip, we decide to skip the beaches and instead focus on the strong sri lankan culture, mainly made of a mix of Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim.

Our first stop will be Anurâdhapura, one of the ancient capitals of Sri Lanka. This World Heritage Site contains a rich collection of archaeological spots of which several remain in use as holy places and temples : the most famous being Ruwanwelisaya (white stupa) as it contains relics of Buddha.
Most of them have been restored.

We have rented a bike to explore them in a cheap and eco way !





From there, we'll head south to our second stop in the Cultural triangle : Dambulla.
This is the largest and best preserved cave temple complex of Sri Lanka, with wonderful paintings and statues !





We won't stay overnight in Dambulla but instead we will push forward up to Sigiriya and make it home for the next 2 days.

First we'll visit Poḷonnaruwa : the second most ancient of Sri Lanka's kingdoms. As for Anurâdhapura, we decide to rent a bike to enjoy the beauty of this huge archeological site (my favorite so far). It's also part of UNESCO and it will cost you another 25USD fee to visit, but definitely worth it.



It's now time to climb the "Lion rock" of Sigiriya : a huge fortress established on a top of this 200m high rock, introduced with a gateway built in a form of an enormous lion (giving its name to the city - Sigiriya means Lion).

We have really appreciated the frescoes : for once it won't be Buddha's but instead gorgeous representation of Sri Lankan ladies (unfortunately no pictures allowed).




Our next stop will be Kandy, apparently base of one of the most scenic train ride in the World !
We won't take the full ride up to Ella (7hours) but we will stop instead in Nuwara Eliya, famous for its country side filled by tea plantation.

We have visited Pedro Tea Factory, trying to understand the tea process and fabrication, but the main reason we came in Nuwara Eliya was to hike the Horton Plains National Park and its famous "World's End" hike (under the mist in this cloud forest)!

We still had a great time and now deserve a good local ayurveda (meaning "the science of life") massage:

Ayurveda represents a system of healing that has been perfected over more than five thousand years. It is famed as South Asia's ancient health care system based on herbs and diet. Ayurveda sees health and disease in holistic terms. It takes into account the relationship between energy and matter. This system of healing believes in treatment of not just the part affected by disease but the individual as a whole. It emphasizes on the harmony of mind, body and spirit to cure diseases.

It's almost already the end of our experience in Sri Lanka, and we'll forever remember the kindness of those people and the beauty of the country (including amazing roads conditions).

We still have a lot to visit, especially the beach side so it's not a goodbye but a see you soon.
