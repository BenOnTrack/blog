Heading south to Kerala and its famous backwaters

<b> Kerala </b>

After another terrible night bus trip from Bangalore, and a small ferry trip, I've reached Kochi, my first city in Kerala on the Malabar coast of India.

Kochi (and its fort) has nothing really interesting to offer apart from its lively fish market and unfamous chinese fishnet.



I'll quickly reach Alleppey, famous for its beach vibes, canals and backwaters. We took a tour with Zostel hostel, enjoying this so-called "Venice of the East". It's been a really interesting and relaxing experience, especially eating with locals on a flooded house! Most people rent a houseboat and cross the whole canal from Alleppey to Kollam. I'll do the same with the local ferry, heading to Trivandrum to catch my flight to Sri Lanka !
