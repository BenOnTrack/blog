### The Story

I’ve spent the last 2 days in Darjeeling, hoping from travel agency to travel agency seeking for any other hikers interested to trek within Singalila National Park but in vain.

After a quick check with the tourist office I’ve decided to go by myself knowing I’ll find a guide (which is mandatory) at the entrance of the park. Waking up at 5.30am, I’ve already arranged my bag storage with the hotel I’m staying in (this time I’ll hike with the small one), a last goodbye to Andy my fellow traveler and I’m already in a Jeep for Maney Bhanjyang, point of entry to any hike in the area. The “Highlander Guide Welfare Association” found me a guide within 10min  and I’m passing my first police checkpoint for Nepal...The hike I’m planning to do is on the ridge between Nepal and India and they warned me to bring my passport as I’ll be crossing the borders between both countries multiple times. It’s the best opportunity to see Everest (8840m) and Kanchenjunga (8586m), respectively n1 and n3 of highest peaks in the world, K2 (8611m), in Pakistan, being N2.

### Day 1 : Maney Bhanjyang - Jaubari 

After a quick momo breakfast, I’m greeting my new guide « Buddha » (no it’s not a joke)  who will join me on this 5 days trip. He’s wearing his sneakers, a jogging (could have been my pyjama) and a small backpack like mine. 

The way is easy to follow, and we gradually climb through beautiful forests (rhododendrons, magnolias, primulas, bamboos and pines) surrounded by a deep (even sometimes cold) mist.
