I've landed in Mumbai (also known as Bombay), capital city of Maharashtra. It's funny to know that Mumbai city population exceeds the entire belgian population. Actually it's the most densely populated megacity in the world.


<b>Maharashtra</b>

It's past midnight, the airport is huge, the customs are easier to pass than I thought and a Uber staff helps me getting some Wifi to book my first indian ride (knowing Uber is a good deal not to get screwed by local taxi, especially when you don't have any local currency on arrival).

I guess I'm not used to see that many people at the same place at the same time, especially when it's now 2am and that there is more traffic jam than in the middle of the day, but I still enjoy the special atmosphere and vibes I'm getting here.

Mumbai is that kind of busy city I've never really experienced in the past, but after a few hours wandering in the city you easily make your own way like a local : crossing the boulevard in the middle of the traffic (running for your life as they say), healing a rickshaw (tuk-tuk), hoping on a moving train,...kind of adventure I was looking for.

With all this rain I won't make it to Dharavi slum

I forgot to mention that Ganesh (widely revered as the remover of obstacles, the patron of arts and sciences and the deva of intellect and wisdom, cf Wikipedia) is running on for 10 days all over the country and especially here in Mumbai ! At the end of the festival, the idols (mostly statue) will be immersed in the most convenient body of water (which will be the ocean for Mumbai).

Unfortunately it's the monsoon period and it's pouring rain ! I guess it's time to go south.
