### Penang
The "Pearl of the Orient" is regarded as the food capital of Malaysia, but since 2012 George Town became famous for its Street Art.

George Town, Malaysia's second largest city, is also home to a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as you will notice on those pictures.

Sit, relax, and enjoy street art from your coach !
